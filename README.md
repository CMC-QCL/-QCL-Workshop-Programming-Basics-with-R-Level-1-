### [QCL Workshop] Programming Basics with R (Level 1)

## Summary

You have data and you need a tool to do something with it. Whether you’re a data scientist, political scientist, economist, or biologist, it’s increasingly apparent that data is ever-present and we need to do a little statistics, a little visualization, and a little manipulation of this data. That is precisely what the programming language R is built for. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of getting started with R and R Studio.
